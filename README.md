# storygen

storygen is an open-source and simple tool to do storyboards.

# C++ port

I consider revamping this project into C++ for various reasons, and mainly because of the fact that C++ programming for storyboarding might be more handy. In fact, we don't need a language so high-level to do such works, but to make the storyboard export more longer. Doing it in C++ might not only improve the speed of the program, but will also make it easier for newcomers to get a grip on storyboarding.

I don't plan on deleting the C# project though. I still want people to have access to it, but I might not carry on updating it. Maybe, I don't know for now.
